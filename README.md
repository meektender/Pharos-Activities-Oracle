**Innovation: "Interaction Verification"** The foundation of the Pharos Activity Oracle. This version establishes the core logic for identifying and logging unique wallet interactions within the Pharos Atlantic ecosystem.

**Technical Fix:** Implemented a lightweight event-emission architecture to ensure real-time tracking of multi-wallet testing data while maintaining low gas overhead on the testnet.
