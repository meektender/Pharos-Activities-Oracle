🌊 Overview
Pharos Activity Oracle explores how real user interactions can be recorded, verified, and extended on-chain.
Instead of starting complex, the project begins with a minimal legacy baseline, then evolves through clearly documented versions — mirroring how real-world protocols are built.
🧠 Design Approach
Start small
Observe real behavior
Add constraints gradually
Never rewrite history
Each version solves one clear problem.
🧩 Versioning Model
Version
Focus
v0 (Legacy)
Baseline interaction tracking
v1
Cooldown & anti-spam logic
v2
Policy-driven rules
v3
Automation & hooks
🧱 v0 — Legacy Baseline
Goal:
Establish a trusted on-chain reference for user interaction.
Capabilities:
Detects first-time interactions
Tracks unique users
Emits transparent on-chain events
This version is intentionally simple and serves as the foundation for all future upgrades.
🚀 Deployment (v0)
Network: Pharos Atlantic Testnet
Contract: PharosActivity_Legacy

🛣️ Roadmap
v1: Time-based cooldown (1 hour)
v2: Rule-based interaction policies
v3: Hook-compatible automation
Each version builds forward without replacing the past.
📌 Current Status
v0 deployed & verified
